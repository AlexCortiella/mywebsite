# Overview
The objective of the INSIEME project under PSAAP III is to exploit Exascale computing systems to predict a complex multi-physics phenomenon with combined innovations in task-based programming, runtime environments, physical models, numerical algorithms, data analysis, learning at scale and uncertainty quantification.

# Motivation
The overarching problem is the prediction of reliability of in-space ignition of cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen propellants in a rocket combustor by using pulsed high-energy lasers. Laser-induced ignition, as opposed to pyrotechnic or pyrophoric ignition, allows repeatable, controlled ignition which is key to attitude control and injection of spacecrafts in orbit. The problem involves a broad set of physical phenomena, including multiphase compressible fluid dynamics, phase change, turbulence, mixing, laser-induced ignition, and combustion.

# Method
Laser-induced ignition has a game-changing technological potential for re-startable upper stage engines and reaction control thrusters of spacecrafts. A laser pulse of approximately 10 nanoseconds of duration with a wavelength of about 1000 nanometers is focused into a small spot of 10-100 microns of diameter in the rocket combustor, delivering a power density of 10- 100 gigawatts per square centimeter and breaking down the gaseous methane/liquid oxigen propellant mixture.
