title: "INSIEME PSAAP-III"
description: "The objective of the INSIEME project under PSAAP III is to exploit Exascale computing systems to predict a complex multi-physics phenomenon with combined innovations in task-based programming, runtime environments, physical models, numerical algorithms, data analysis, learning at scale and uncertainty quantification. The overarching problem is the prediction of reliability of in-space ignition of cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen propellants in a rocket combustor by using pulsed high-energy lasers. The problem involves a broad set of physical phenomena, including multiphase compressible fluid dynamics, phase change, turbulence, mixing, laser-induced ignition, and combustion."
