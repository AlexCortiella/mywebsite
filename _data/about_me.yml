description: I am an aerospace engineer passionate about space engineering, spacecraft design and computational mechanics. I obtained a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research focuses on nonlinear system identification of aerospace systems using machine learning techniques from noisy measurements. Other passions include trail running and fitness, reading human interaction and psychology books and traveling around the world to learn from other cultures. 


row_one: I am doctor in Aerospace Engineering. I am originally from Barcelona, Spain and moved to the United States to continue my graduate studies thanks to the Balsells Fellowship I was awarded in 2016. After graduating from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) in 2014 and obtaining a B.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering, I joined the UPC Nanosat Lab team. The NanoSat Lab research group focuses on designing and developing nano-satellites to test state-of-the-art science instruments and remote sensing techniques. During my time there, I was the responsible of developing and validating the attitude determination and control system of the 3Cat-2, a six-unit nanosatellite aiming at testing novel GNSS-R concepts. 3Cat-2 nanosatellite was successfully put into orbit in 2016.

row_two: After my experience at NanoSat Lab, I moved to the United States to pursue a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. My main research areas of interest comprise data-driven modeling & machine learning, computational mechanics, and spaceflight dynamics. During my MS, I worked with Profesor K.C. Park on finite element formulations for multi-physics problems. After completing my MS, I joined the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC) to continue my studies towards a Ph.D. My research focused on system identification of complex mechanical systems with Dr. Alireza Doostan, merging fields such as nonlinear dynamical systems, machine learning and data-driven modeling.

row_three: Apart from being passionate about space engineering, data-driven modeling and computational mechanics, I am a fervent lover of all kinds of sports and fitness. I played team handball for 17 years, competing all over Spain. I am also keen on trail running, obstacle course racing, and downhill mountain biking. Other activities I love doing include traveling and meeting people with diverse backgrounds, and reading books about psychology, human interactions and finance.
